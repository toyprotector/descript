# descript
de-script a web page


# Usage
Inside the project's directory type:

> php -S localhost:8080

Then access localhost:8080 from a web browser, enter the desired web page's url to the input element and press the button.

The url needs to contain the protocol, either http or https; it does not follow redirects automatically.

# This is a work in progress

The idea of local proxies to edit a page's html was given by Cudder in 2017 or 2018, and only now I got to it. 

Am I a lazy bastard!
